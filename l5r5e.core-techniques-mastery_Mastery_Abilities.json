These individuals spend much of their adult lives traveling in the Phoenix lands and beyond, carefully and patiently relocating spirits from places of abundance to places in need of a kami's presence to mend a disparity. Acting as safe vessels, these spirit seekers invite the kami to dwell within their bodies until the kami can be released into a new area.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Rings: +1 Earth, +1 Water</li>\n<li>Starting Skills (choose five): +1 Composition, +1 Courtesy, +1 Games, +1 Martial Arts [Ranged], +1 Performance, +1 Sentiment, +1 Theology</li>\n<li>Honor: 4S</li>\n<li>Techniques Available: Invocations (\"), Kata (~)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Starting Techniques:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Invocations (choose two): Armor of Earth, Extinguish, Dominion of Suijin, Tempest of Air</li>\n<li>Kata (choose two): Striking as Air, Striking as Earth, Striking as Fire, Striking as Water</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>The Body Is a Shrine (School Ability)</h3>\n<p>When you are in the presence of a kami (such as an elemental kami or other Supernatural being the GM deems appropriate), you may make a TN 4 Courtesy check using a ring associated with the kami's element (its highest ring) or one of its elements (if it has multiple highest rings). If you fail, you suffer 3 fatigue and 3 strife and cannot attempt to act as a vessel again this session.</p>\n<p>If you succeed, you convince the kami to use your body as a vessel. This grants you the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any time you make a check using one of the kami's elements, you may reroll a number of dice up to your school rank.</li>\n<li>Any time you make a check using one of the kami's opposing elements, increase the TN by 1 and add one kept • set to :;, Q .</li>\n<li>If you unmask, the kami is released (see Releasing Kami).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Starting Outfit:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Traveling clothes, sanctified robes, yumi (bow), quiver of arrows, wakizashi (short sword), knife, bowyer's kit or divination kit.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>OPPOSING ELEMENTS</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Air is opposed by Fire.</li>\n<li>Earth is opposed by Air.</li>\n<li>Fire is opposed by Water.</li>\n<li>Water is opposed by Earth.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>PROPER OFFERINGS</h3>\n<p>Proper gifts and reverence, as discussed on page 189 of the core rulebook, can reduce TN of The Body Is a Shrine ability as if it were an invocation.</p>\n\n<h3>RELEASING KAMI</h3>\n<p>As a downtime activity, you may peacefully release one or more kami you are housing. If there is a nearby shrine or other appropriately spiritual place, the kami likely settles there. Alternately, if you unmask or if the GM deems it narratively appropriate, the spirits within you can become irate and escape, manifesting using their standard profiles (such as the manifest kami found on pages 322-324 of the core rulebook).</p>",
