If Sanuki presented a poem, Shikitora would present one on the following night in an effort to be the most praiseworthy. If Sanuki wore a beautiful kimono, then the one worn by Shikitora must be ten times as lovely. Sanuki’s heart was broken due to an ill-fated love, and she threw herself from the roof of the Imperial Palace. Everyone was saddened by this and spoke admiringly of the late poet who had died for love. Shiba Shikitora threw herself from a roof twice as high on the next day.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You cannot voluntarily pass up an opportunity to one-up a rival or demonstrate your superiority over someone in the eyes of others.</li>\n<li>After performing a check to compete with someone to demonstrate your excellence (such as a Performance [Air] check to convince an audience of something before a rival can or a Smithing [Air] check to refine a weapon to perfection before presenting it as a gift to your lord), you receive 3 strife.

You would rather go hungry than accept food or drink from anyone you do not trust completely, unless you witness that food being consumed by someone else first. When you are offered food or drink by others you do not trust, you cannot help but wonder if they are secretly plotting your demise.</li>\n<li>After performing a check to interact with someone you do not completely trust who has offered you food or drink (such as a Sentiment [Air] check to try to determine someone else’s intentions or a Games [Air] check to play a game well against someone who has offered you food), you receive 3 strife. If this is the first time this has occurred this scene, gain 1 Void point.</li>\n</ul>",
