        "description": "<h2>Wreak Havoc</h2>\n<p>Rank 4</p>\n<p>While Leadership counsels against the needlessly destruction of the enemy's assets—for these can become one's own assets if seized—sometimes fire provides an avenue that subtler means could not. Baggage trains, fortifications, or even the tents of the wounded—for dishonorable commanders, any of these can make tempting targets for the flame.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Activation:</strong> Once per game session as an Attack and Movement action during a mass battle, you may make a Skulduggery (Fire) check targeting one enemy leader's cohort. The TN is equal to the vigilance of that cohort's leader. You may expend 1 charge of blasting powder and forfeit honor equal to half your honor rank (rounded up) to reduce the TN by 2 (to a minimum of 1).</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Effects:</strong> If you succeed, you achieve one of the following:</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduce the difficulty value of a fortification the target is occupying by 4 plus your bonus successes. If this reduces the difficulty value to 0 or lower, the fortification is destroyed; any army with a cohort occupying it receives attrition equal to your bonus successes, and any leader or commander inside suffers a critical strike severity equal to 6 plus your bonus successes.</li>\n<li>Remove the Confining and Entangling terrain quality from a fortification the target cohort occupies, but add the Dangerous and Obscuring terrain qualities to that area as it catches ablaze.</li>\n<li>Remove one cohort ability from the target cohort. This ability is restored when the army resupplies (such as when making a maintenance check, as described on page 115).</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Additionally, if you succeed, the target leader must resist with a TN 5 Command check (Air 6, Water 3) or their army suffers panic equal to your ranks in Performance plus their shortfall.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>New Opportunities:</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Fire ⟛: If you succeed, the target cohort's leader suffers a critical strike with severity equal to 6 plus your bonus successes.</li>\n<li>Fire ⟜'> ⟝: The target cohort's leader suffers the Dazed condition.</li>\n<li>Fire ⟝H: If you succeed, you may expend a number of additional charges of blasting powder up to spent this way to add two bonus successes.</li>\n</ul>",
