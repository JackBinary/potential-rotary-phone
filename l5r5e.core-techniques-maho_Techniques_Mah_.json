Directing them toward a target with a vile rite and profane words that seem to warp the air, the mahō-tsukai afflicts a poor soul with a spiritual malady that can fester and bloom, fueling darker curses still. Spiritualists can perceive kansen as wretched, ghostly figures, clinging to their victim and dragging them inexorably toward a wretched end wrought by their worst nature.</li>\n<li><strong>Activation</strong>: As an Attack and Scheme action, you may make a Theology check targeting one character at range 0–1. This check uses any ring of your choice, and the TN of the check is equal to the target’s vigilance.</li>\n<li><strong>Effects</strong>: If you succeed, you curse your target, causing them to suffer the Afflicted condition. If you fail, the target rebuffs your efforts.
