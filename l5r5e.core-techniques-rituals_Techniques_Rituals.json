        "description": "<h2>Tea Ceremony</h2>\n<p>When Lady Doji served tea for the very first Emperor, the tea ceremony was born. Ceremony styles vary among the clans, from the gilded tea rooms of the Phoenix to the imperfect tea bowls of the Dragon, the early morning gatherings of the Crane to the snow- and moon-viewing ceremonies of the Scorpion. However, at its core the tea ceremony is fundamentally an appreciation of tea and, if done well, a spiritual moment for its participants. The tea represents all five elements: the fire used to heat the water, the earth from which the tea is grown, and the air that carries the aroma of the tea. Finally, void holds all four elements together, and brings in the mysterious fifth element, the moment of harmony and tranquility as one sips the tea.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Activation:</strong> Once per game session, as a downtime activity using a tea set, you may make a TN 2 Performance (Void) check targeting yourself and a number of other characters up to your ranks in Culture, who are also participants. Up to one other participant may assist, providing the usual benefits (see Assistance on page 26).</li>\n<li><strong>Effects:</strong> Each target removes 3 strife, plus additional strife equal to your bonus successes.</li>\n<li><strong>New Opportunities:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>(op): Reduce the TN of each target’s next check by 1.</li>\n<li>(op)+: Each target removes 1 fatigue, plus 1 fatigue per (op) (op) spent this way.</li>\n<li>(op) (op): If you succeed, each target gains 1 Void point.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Guests are escorted to the site of the tea ceremony, ideally a tea house specially designed for this function or another place of elegant simplicity. There, they are asked to cleanse their mouths and hands—and also their souls—much in the same way purification is performed at shrines. The guests sit in a prescribed order and the host makes the tea in front of them in a series of elaborate, meticulous steps, each gesture or position passed down to them from tea masters through the ages. Finally, the host serves the tea to the guests, who partake of the same bowl one after another. After the tea has been finished, and the utensils cleaned and put away, the guests leave the tea house in the order they arrived, and the host’s final bow signifies the end of the ceremony.</p>\n<p><strong>Rank 2</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you succeed, choose one of the following omens that you see in the target’s near future:</li>\n<li>Omen of the Azure Dragon: The next time the target performs a check using a skill from the Artisan skill group this game session, the target adds a kept <span class=\"symbol\"></span> set to an (op) <span class=\"symbol\"></span> result.</li>\n<li>Omen of the Black Tortoise: The next time the target performs a check using a skill from the Scholar skill group this game session, the target adds a kept <span class=\"symbol\"></span> set to an (op) <span class=\"symbol\"></span> result.</li>\n<li>Omen of the White Tiger: The next time the target performs a check using a skill from the Martial skill group this game session, the target adds a kept <span class=\"symbol\"></span> set to an (op) <span class=\"symbol\"></span> result.</li>\n<li>Omen of the Vermilion Bird: The next time the target performs a check using a skill from the Social skill group this game session, the target adds a kept <span class=\"symbol\"></span> set to an (op) <span class=\"symbol\"></span> result.</li>\n<li>Omen of the Weaver and the Cowherd: The next time the target performs a check using a skill from the Trade skill group this game session, the target adds a kept <span class=\"symbol\"></span> set to an (op) <span class=\"symbol\">�",

Each trap occupies a position at range 0–5 of where you made the check, and triggers after a character moves to range 0 of it. After the trap triggers, the target must make a check to resist its effects. Choose each trap from the following list:</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Deadfall Trap:</strong> A trap that drops stones, sharp objects, or other dangerous debris onto the target. The target must resist with a TN 5 Fitness check (Water 3, Fire 6) or suffer physical damage equal to two times their shortfall.</li>\n<li><strong>Pitfall Trap:</strong> A trap that causes the target to fall into a pit, and can include sharpened wood or bamboo spikes for extra harm. The target must resist with a TN 4 Fitness check (Earth 2, Water 5) or suffer 6 physical damage and the Dazed and Disoriented conditions.</li>\n<li><strong>Rope Snare:</strong> A counterweighted trap that snares the target, pulling them off their feet. The target must resist with a TN 5 (Fire 3, Earth 6) or suffer physical damage equal to their shortfall that ignores their physical resistance and the Immobilized condition.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>New Opportunities:</strong></li>\n<li>(op)+: Increase the TN of the check to resist these traps by 1, plus 1 for every additional (op) (op) spent this way.</li>\n<li>(op): If the trap inflicts damage, increase that damage by your ranks in Skulduggery.

        "description": "<h2>Trance of Lives Past</h2>\n<h3>Rank 4 [Monk]</h3>\n<p>Time and death are boundaries that appear impermeable to most. However, some spiritualists and kihō practitioners can press up against these boundaries and bend them, if not break them fully, drawing forth knowledge and memories from lives past. The user can follow the spiritual energy they imprinted upon a person, place, or thing long ago, reconnecting to it and reawakening lost memories of that past existence. This may even cause the personality of the previous life to briefly resurface - for better or for worse, as that entity may have had its own goals and desires unrelated to the present character's, or even opposed to them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Activation:</strong> As a downtime activity, you may make a TN 4 Meditation (Void) check targeting a place, object, or individual one of your past lives. Reduce the TN by 2 if all three of the following are true:<ul>\n<li>You have one or more items (other than your target) from your past life</li>\n<li>You are in a place (other than your target) important to your past life</li>\n<li>You have interacted with an individual from your past life (other than the target) within the last 24 hours</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>Effects:</strong> If you succeed, your GM reveals a specific memory you have related to your target. If your GM is unsure what the significance should be, they might ask you to help come up with the specifics of the memory, and then offer modifications to your proposed recollection based on the needs of the story.</li>\n<li><strong>New Opportunities:</strong><ul>\n<li>(op)+: Reduce the TN of your next check related to the target by 1.</li>\n<li>(op) (op) (op) (op): If you fail, you become possessed by your past self until the end of the scene. Use this character’s profile instead of your own (an NPC profile determined by your GM).
