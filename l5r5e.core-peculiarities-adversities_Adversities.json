The less important this period is to your identity, the longer it should be (for example, a single day lost might be sufficient if the character committed a terrible act during that time and struggles to understand how or why, whereas a full decade of lost memories might be insufficient if they are not especially foundational to who the character is). The player and GM should work together to determine the amount and importance of memories lost. Skills and abilities acquired during the lost time are largely retained, even if the character does not remember the act of developing them.</li>\n<li>When you make a check for which you must recall information you learned during the period of lost memories (such as a Culture [Void] check to intuit how to behave in a particular situation similar or related to one you encountered during that time or a Meditation [Void] check to understand your past decisions), you must choose and reroll two dice containing (su) or (ex). After resolving the check, if you failed, you gain 1 Void point.</li>\n</ul>",

I’m here to improve my mind, my soul,’ they say.<br>Enlightenment is a hard path, testing the spirit at every turn. You will stumble. You will fall. You will get back up again and climb once more. If your body cannot handle lifting a rock, if you cannot be like the oxen who tills the soil for simple grass, how can you expect to know the universe?”<br>- Togashi Kyogi, from their treatise, “To Fall is To Fly”</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Type: Physical</li>\n<li>Effects: The following apply to a character with the Out of Shape adversity:</li>\n<li>You have neglected your physical fitness, whether by choice or due to a health issue. Regardless, you become noticeably more winded than others during physical activities.</li>\n<li>When you make a check that requires physical exertion (such as a Martial Arts [Melee] [Earth] check to outlast your opponent in a duel or a Performance [Earth] check to recite a very long, taxing poem), you must choose and reroll two dice containing (su) or (ex). After resolving the check, if you failed, you gain 1 Void point.</li>\n</ul>",
