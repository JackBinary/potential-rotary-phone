It towers above the tallest of humans, yet can find its way through the slightest of cracks. The slightest slip of concentration while guiding such a being can lead to untold devastation as the child of the tempest carves its way across the landscape.</p>\n<p><strong>Activation:</strong> As a Support action, you may make a TN 6 Theology (Air) check targeting one position at range 3–5.</p>\n<p><strong>Effects:</strong> If you succeed, you summon a Manifest Air Kami (see page 322) to fight for you. It appears at the target position and obeys you for two rounds, plus additional rounds equal to your bonus successes, taking its turn immediately after yours each round. When this effect ends, it departs or, if stirred to particular ire, begins to follow its own directives. If it begins to act independently, it does not attack the shugenja who summoned it unless provoked.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Air (op):</strong> The manifest air kami arrives in a cyclone that hurls aside anything nearby.

Even as the words echo, the shugenja’s hands snap open, and motes of flame trail from their fingertips, searing their way toward the objects of the shugenja’s ire. If the shugenja has the strength of will to maintain their focus, they can direct the motes with amazing precision and burn tiny, searing holes in their targets. However, if the shugenja lets their heart swell with wrath or fury, the motes bloom into tiny infernos that seek to consume anything they hit and leave only ash.<br>Activation: As an Attack action, you may make a TN 3 Theology (Fire) check targeting a number of characters up to your Fire Ring at range 1–3.<br>Effects: If you succeed, you smite each target with a stream of fire.

If the invocation is performed properly and the shugenja’s cause is judged worthy, the sky cracks and a thunderbolt descends from the heavens, blasting through anything in its path. It lands writhing in the shugenja's hand, forming a weapon that appears in the shape pictured in the shugenja's mind.
