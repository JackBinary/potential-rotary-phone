One who attunes their senses to nonexistence can perceive the other possible realities that ripple outward from each moment of action. The signs often do not come as complete visions, but as brief flashes: hazy vignettes of a world that never was. The rustling of leaves from a tree that has not yet grown, the first laugh shared with a new friend, the scent of blood and burning flesh. However, these rippling potential truths can become intoxicating, drawing an undisciplined mind deeper and deeper into twisted realms of refracted possibility until there is no escape. This is what those who study the Void call the \"Lying Darkness\": the trap that awaits all who let their worldly desires guide their ventures into the Void.</li>\n<li>Activation: Once per session, immediately after you or another character at range 0-3 performs an action or makes a choice of great consequence in a narrative scene, you may make a TN 2 Theology (Void) check targeting that character to peer beyond the lie of time and find another outcome.</li>\n<li>Effects: If you succeed, you scry for another outcome and return to the moment before the action was performed. All effects and outcomes stemming from the action are undone, but only you and the target are aware of the reality that no longer is. If you are the target, you may choose the same or a different action or decision. If another character is the target, you may say up to five words to the target before they act or make a decision.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>New Opportunities: If you target another character and you succeed, you may perform an action immediately before the target performs their new action.</li>\n<li>Magnitude: Magnitude 1+: You see one possible consequence of the original action or decision that would occur before the end of the scene.</li>\n<li>Magnitude 2+: You see one additional possible consequence of the original action or decision that would occur in the next year.</li>\n<li>Magnitude 3+: You see one additional possible consequence of the original action or decision that would occur in the next decades, or even further in the future.</li>\n</ul>",

While some who have seen this technique describe it as the swinging of an invisible sword, the truth is that the stroke is not truly to attack the foe.

If a character uses Witness the End to see how to undo something beyond a single human's scope, such as destroying a mountain or ending the Yogo bloodline curse, they cannot turn around and make a check to undo it without undertaking the narrative preparations such an effort would require (vast earthworks or a spiritual quest that would likely take many encounters to complete, for instance). At the GM's discretion, Witness the End can be used in such cases to get a hint of where to start on one's quest, but it provides no direct benefit to related checks until various narrative goals have been completed.</li>\n</ul>",
