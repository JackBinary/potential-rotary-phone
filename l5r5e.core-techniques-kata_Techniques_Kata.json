Riding across a battlefield is a far more challenging task, however, and fully using the advantages a mount provides can take intense training for both steed and rider. <br><br>Activation: As a Movement and Support action, if you are riding a mount, you may spur it to move more quickly. <br>Effects: Your mount receives an amount of fatigue up to your ranks in Survival, then carries you that many range bands plus one, to a maximum of 6.</li>\n<li><strong>Thunderous Hooves Style</strong> <strong>Rank 4</strong>: The Ujik whom the Ki-Rin Clan first encountered as they traveled west were terrifying enemies not only because of their skill with the bow, but also because of the experience with which they handled their steeds, easily breaking infantry formations unprepared to face such heavy cavalry. Over the centuries, the Unicorn Clan has both adopted the Ujik’s riding methods and extensively studied many of their cavalry tactics to bring an entirely new art of battle to Rokugan. <br><br>Activation: When you make a Fitness check as part of a Movement action while mounted, you may spend \u0002 in the following way: <br>\u0002+: One character at range 0 of your ending position per \u0002 spent this way suffers fatigue and strife equal to your mount’s silhouette unless they choose to immediately move 1 range band away from you. <br>\u0002 \u0002 \u0002: Your mount may perform a Strike action with your assistance, targeting one character at range 0 (see Assistance, on page 26 of the core rulebook).</li>\n<li><strong>Void Embrace Style</strong> <strong>Rank 5</strong>: It is said that some martial artists of surpassing skill can give themselves over wholly to the Void for an instant, foreseeing the exact arc of an attack and completely negating it with little more than a gentle brush of the hand. Tales abound of masters who matched steel with only a flimsy reed or caught an opponent’s sword mid-swing, but few warriors can say they have personally seen such mastery on display. <br><br>Activation: When you make a Meditation (Void) check during a duel or skirmish, you may spend \u0002 in the following way: <br>\u0002 \u0002: Choose one character you can perceive, then secretly select a number. The next time you are dealt damage by that character or suffer a critical strike inflicted by that character, reveal the number you chose. If the number is higher than the damage or the severity of the critical strike (before any reductions), you suffer it as normal and this effect ends. If the number is lower than or equal to the damage or the severity of the critical strike, reduce it by that amount, to a minimum of 0. If you reduce it to 0, the character you chose suffers 5 strife. If you reduce the severity of a critical strike to 0 this way, you do not suffer it. This effect persists until the end of your next turn.</li>\n</ul>",

        "description": "<h2>Skittering Shift</h2>\n<h3>Rank 3 [Nezumi]</h3>\n<p>The nezumi live in dangerous places, often surrounded by predators against which the only defense is evasion. Oni of the Shadowlands and ancient yōkai of the Shinomen forest cannot be fought head-on and must thus be evaded to be survived. Further, the dense terrain of tunnels and forests make it difficult to bring down large targets through ranged weapons and attrition, as hunters in an open plain do. Thus, nezumi martial arts emphasize constant readiness to scamper aside, dropping onto all fours to bound out of the way of a crushing blow or scuttling back into the shadows to avoid being surrounded by pack hunters. Humans can learn these techniques as well, though they must be adapted somewhat to account for the particulars of human physiology, and study with the nezumi themselves is a necessity.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Activation:</strong> Once per scene as a Movement and Support action, you may receive 2 fatigue to skitter with preternatural speed, evading incoming attacks to gain distance toward or away from your foe.</li>\n<li><strong>Form Requirement:</strong> You must be in a form capable of moving naturally on all fours.</li>\n<li><strong>Effects:</strong> Increase the TN of Attack action checks targeting you by 1. After an Attack action check targeting you fails, you may move 1 range band. After you defend against damage, you may move 1 range band. This effect persists until the end of your next turn.</li>\n</ul>",

Even a non-prehensile tail can be used to deliver a quick blow from an unexpected angle, knocking the target from their feet or setting up a grapple.
