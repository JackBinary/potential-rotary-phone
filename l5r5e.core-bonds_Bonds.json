Two rōnin might cross paths again years later only to find themselves employed by rivals, or a rōnin might return to town to discover that their lover of old is now the magistrate whom they must petition for work. Or those who parted on ill terms might discover they must now work together again. Regardless of the particulars of their dissolution and reunion, this bond represents people with a romantic history who find themselves crossing paths frequently, thrown together once again, or otherwise entangled in one another’s circumstances.</li>\n<li>An old flame knows your best and worst qualities — and any advantages or disadvantages you possessed at the time you were together — and you know theirs), and is likely willing to use these to achieve their own goals as long as it does not significantly harm you. However, some fondness lingers, and they will do you small favors, such as giving you hints about opportunities you might pursue, warning you of oncoming danger, or pointing you in the direction of someone who has something you are seeking. This help most often arrives when it has not been requested.</li>\n<li>Your old flame’s allies are cautious to hostile when dealing with you, depending on how the relationship dissolved, and are generally unwilling to help you unless you offer another incentive.

Even so, sometimes individuals make long, lasting bonds that build into a true and unconditional trust. Whether partners are close friends, spouses, lovers, fellow soldiers, or simply other survivors of the outskirts of society who rely on each other’s helping hands to get by, this bond represents a group that has come to work almost perfectly as a unit, without hesitation or fear that they stand alone.</li>\n<li>A partner trusts you implicitly, and is willing to assist you with nearly anything so long as you can offer a rational explanation of why it is necessary or important. However, they will also intervene to stop you from doing things that they think will be harmful to you.</li>\n<li>Friends and allies of your partner at least tolerate you, will generally give you the benefit of the doubt, and will at least hear you out if you need something, though they generally will not do favors for you unless the favor also benefits your partner directly. Enemies of your partner view you as an enemy, and will seek to remove you from the equation if they think you will impede their schemes against your partner.</li>\n<li>If your bond rank is Î or higher, your partner will more proactively intervene on your behalf instead of being asked for assistance, and may be more assertive in insisting that you grow beyond tendencies that are harmful to you, such as recklessness. However, if you insist that something is important, your partner will back you with the full means at their disposal, even if you do not explain why it is important to you.</li>\n<li>Once per scene, you may call upon your bond to know exactly what your partner is thinking — or was thinking at a previous time), or to have your partner know exactly what you are thinking, without any direct communication between the two of you. You — or your partner) must express this idea in five words or fewer, plus additional words equal to your bond rank.

A rōnin might have forsworn their rank and stature to protect the lost heir of their lord, hiding the child from those who see them as an inconvenient loose end—or they might have been the one to refuse such an order, and fled to protect someone their own lord desired to see dead. Or perhaps they simply encountered someone who needed them and their compassion forced its way through the rōnin’s world-weary exterior. Whatever the case, a character with this bond has someone who is dependent on them, and looks to them both for guidance and protection in a harsh world.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are the protector, your ward is reliant on you, and cannot fully fend for themselves in the world, either due to their age, health, or circumstances.

They help you with modest favors (offering you a cut in on a job they have taken on, giving you an introduction to someone hiring rōnin, buying your sake when your purse is empty and theirs is less empty), and generally expect you to reciprocate such favors.</li>\n<li>Those with whom your fellowship has worked before are generally inclined to regard you in the same way they do your fellows—if they are rowdy or well-behaved, they will assume the same of you. Your actions also reflect upon members of your fellowship, and if you step out of line such that it endangers the group’s reputation, they intervene to set you on the right path—or to remove you from the group, if you will not repent.</li>\n<li>If your bond rank is 3 or higher, your fellowship’s bonds of loyalty are extremely deep, and other members will accept dangerous jobs with you without question, join your side in battles that do not pay, and perhaps even buy your sake without reminding you about it three times in the next week.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>“Sworn to Duty and to Death” (Bond Ability):</h3>\n<p>At the start of your turn, if you are Compromised or Incapacitated, you may call upon your bond to remove fatigue and strife equal to your bond rank.</p>",
