        "description": "<h2>Victory Without a Sword</h2>\n<h3>Rank 6</h3>\n<p>To win without conflict, to conquer without destroying, to unite with prowess rather than merely subjugating—this is the ideal Akodo is said to have reached by the end of his long and violent life. Though he never put it to words himself, several of his students from his later years did. His lessons were simple. Any battle should be as swiftly won as possible, and the greatest general would be the one who never needed to fight, their superiority clear to all who could see it. To fight at all was its own sort of failure, a lesson he had learned all too well across ceaseless campaigns to unite Rokugan for his Emperor. Of course, up to the end, Akodo found it necessary to fight, so perhaps this ideal was beyond even the Kami of the Lion Clan, a dream image of a world barely visible through one tired eye.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Activation:</strong> As an Attack, Movement, Scheme, and Support action during a mass battle, you may make a TN 6 Tactics (Void) check targeting the enemy commander. Reduce the TN of this check to 4 if all cohorts of the enemy army are in Dangerous, Entangling, or Obscuring terrain. This technique can only be attempted once per army per scene.</li>\n<li><strong>Effects:</strong> If you succeed, the enemy commander immediately resists with a TN 5 Command check (Void 3), adding 1 to the TN for every 10 strength your army has in excess of the enemy army's strength. If the enemy commander succeeds, their army suffers no ill effects. If the enemy commander fails, the enemy army suffers 10 panic for each point of their shortfall. If the enemy army collapses this way, its forces surrender. Individual leaders may choose whether they wish to withdraw or hold the line as their troops surrender.</li>\n<li>If you fail, reduce the TN of Attack action checks targeting the cohorts of leaders in your army by 2 (to a minimum of 1). This effect persists until the end of the scene.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>New Opportunities</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Void *+:</strong> If you succeed, while this effect persists, reduce any fatigue you receive by 1 per * spent this way (to a minimum of 0).</li>\n<li><strong>Void ::&, ::&,:</strong> If you succeed, if you suffer a critical strike this way, it is not applied until the end of the scene, at which point you receive any critical strike results you deferred this way.</li>\n<li><strong>Void *=:</strong> If you succeed and you survive, double any glory you are awarded from your action.</li>\n</ul>",
